While completing this workshop I learned to login to a remote host using
Putty at home and transfer the source code I wrote in Visual Studio. 
I also learned to create, write and save code in a file using nled command in
Matrix. Last but not the least, I also learned to run and compile a solution
in matrix with the gcc command.
